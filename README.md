# pandas

**pandas** is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly and intuitively. The primary data structures in pandas are:

- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types.

## Key Features

- **Easy handling of missing data**: pandas provides a robust way to handle missing data with functions like `isnull()`, `dropna()`, and `fillna()`.
- **Data alignment and manipulation**: Automatically aligns data for you, providing powerful tools for data merging, joining, reshaping, and more.
- **Flexible indexing**: Allows you to access data using labels and position-based indexing.
- **Efficient operations**: Optimized for performance with fast data manipulation capabilities.
- **Input/output tools**: Read and write data from/to different file formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more.

## Installation

You can install pandas using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas
